<p class="nonindent" id="p0031-04-4">This statement, based on the conclusions of the America’s Climate Choices (ACC) panel report <i>Advancing the Science of Climate Change</i>, stems from a substantial array of evidence and is consistent with the conclusions drawn in other recent scientific assessments, including reports by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Although the scientific process is always open to new ideas and results, the fundamental causes and consequences of climate change have been established by many years of scientific research,<sup><a href="/read/12781/chapter/8#notesx-q1" id="p1">1</a></sup> are supported by many different lines of evidence, and have stood firm in the face of careful examination, repeated testing, and the rigorous evaluation of alternative theories and explanations. This chapter provides a brief overview of some basic facts about the risks posed by climate change (see <a href="/read/12781/chapter/4#chap2x-bx2_1">Box 2.1</a>); additional explanation and detail can be found in the reports noted above.</p>

Warming has also been observed specifically in the lower atmosphere<sup><a href="/read/12781/chapter/8#notesx-q3" id="p3">3</a></sup> and the upper oceans.<sup><a href="/read/12781/chapter/8#notesx-q4" id="p4">4</a></sup> Additional, indirect indications of warming include widespread reductions in glaciers and Arctic sea ice,<sup><a href="/read/12781/chapter/8#notesx-q5" id="p5">5</a></sup> rising sea levels,<sup><a href="/read/12781/chapter/8#notesx-q6" id="p6">6</a></sup> and changes in plant and animal species.<sup><a href="/read/12781/chapter/8#notesx-q7" id="p7">7</a></sup></p>

<p class="center1" id="chap2x-bx2_1"><b>BOX 2.1</b><br/><b>Climate Change and Risk</b></p>
<p class="tx">As used here, the term <i>risk</i> applies to undesired events that may occur in the future but are not certain to occur. Analysts typically quantify risks along two dimensions—the probability that an event will occur, and the magnitude or consequence(s) of the event—and multiply the two to get a risk estimate (probability times consequence).<i><sup><a href="#chap2x-ss1" id="chap2x-kp1">a</a></sup></i> Consequences, however, have many dimensions. They vary in terms of which human values and concerns they affect (lives, livelihoods, community integrity, nonhuman species, etc.), where they are likely to occur, whom they may affect, and when they are likely to cause harm. Consequences also vary in terms of perception and significance to those who face the risks—for example, in the degree to which the consequence is understood or evokes dread (unknown risks can sometimes concern people more than other risks), and even in the trust in the organizations that manage such risks (mistrust in the managing organizations tends to increase perceived risk).<i><sup><a href="#chap2x-ss2" id="chap2x-kp2">b</a></sup></i></p>
<p id="p0032-P-2">The risks posed by climate change are thus complex. As this chapter discusses, climate change drives a variety of biophysical processes, which leads to a variety of potential consequences for many things that people value. Risks will change over time, and consequences will be highly variable across different locations and population groups. Scientific analyses can improve understanding of the risks associated with climate change, including how different human reactions might change those risks and at what cost. One way this is done, for instance, is through scenario analyses that illustrate a range of possible future conditions and that can be used to test out the performance of different response strategies. But regardless of how much supporting scientific information is available, making choices about how to act in the face of uncertainty can prove contentious if people disagree about the nature of the risks they face or about which elements of these risks are most important.</p>

<p class="ttx1">model results with knowledge about the vulnerability<sup><a href="/read/12781/chapter/8#notesx-q33" id="p33">33</a></sup> and adaptive capacity of various human and natural systems.</p>
<p class="nonindent" id="p0036-02-2">There are two major sources of uncertainty in future climate projections. One comes from the scenarios of emissions and other socioeconomic changes. Future emissions (and future vulnerability to climate change) will be determined by a complex set of developments taking place around the world—related to population, economic growth, energy, land use, technology and innovation, and other factors. It is not possible to predict how all such factors will change in the coming decades, but scenarios allow us to explore the implications of different pathways.</p>
<p class="nonindent" id="p0036-P-1">The second source of uncertainty is the response of the climate system to the increased concentration of GHGs, or “climate sensitivity.” Even if future emissions were known exactly—that is, if a given emission scenario held true exactly—the magnitude of future climate change and the severity of its impacts cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, due to incomplete knowledge of how the climate system will respond. What is known with a high degree of certainty however, is the direction of the climate system’s response to changes in GHG emissions: that is, reducing GHG emissions will lead to less warming and less severe impacts than if emissions are not reduced.</p>
<p class="nonindent" id="p0036-P-2"><b><i>Significant changes are in store.</i></b> The IPCC’s assessment of future climate change projects that Earth’s average surface temperature will increase (in the absence of new emissions mitigation policies) between 2.0 and 11.5°F (1.1 to 6.4°C) by the end of the 21st century, relative to the average global surface temperature during 1980-1999.<sup><a href="/read/12781/chapter/8#notesx-q34" id="p34">34</a></sup> As discussed above, this range reflects the potential trajectories of future GHG emission rates as well as uncertainties in our understanding of the climate system response. A subset of these results is shown in <a href="/read/12781/chapter/4#chap2x-fig2_3">Figures 2.3</a> and <a href="/read/12781/chapter/4#chap2x-fig2_4">2.4</a>.</p>
<p class="nonindent" id="p0036-P-3">One notable feature of future climate projections is that the impacts of the differences among GHG emission scenarios grows with time. For example, the lowest and highest emission scenarios in <a href="/read/12781/chapter/4#chap2x-fig2_3">Figure 2.3</a> lead to similar temperature changes over the next few decades, but very large differences in temperature by the end of the century.<sup><a href="/read/12781/chapter/8#notesx-q35" id="p35">35</a></sup> This represents both a challenge and an opportunity—a challenge because emissions reductions that people make today will have little immediate effect on the climate; an opportunity because emissions reduction efforts made in the near term will affect climate outcomes many decades from now (see <a href="/read/12781/chapter/4#chap2x-bx2_2">Box 2.2</a>).</p>
<p class="nonindent" id="p0036-P-4">Two other notable features of the climate projections shown in <a href="/read/12781/chapter/4#chap2x-fig2_3">Figures 2.3</a> and <a href="/read/12781/chapter/4#chap2x-fig2_4">2.4</a> relate to the temporal scales involved.

<p class="center1" id="chap2x-bx2_2"><b>BOX 2.2</b><br/><b>Emissions Headroom</b></p>
<p class="tx">Although the question of what constitutes a “safe” level of climate change remains a matter of active debate, the United States and much of the international community have expressed support for the goal of limiting global temperature rise relative to the pre-industrial times to no more than 2°C (3.6°F). This target is often stated to be equivalent to limiting global atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to no more than 450 ppm. Because of uncertainties in climate sensitivity, however, this is not a precise relationship. The best estimate from climate models is that there is a 50 percent probability of limiting global temperature increase to 2°C or less if CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are not allowed to rise above 450 ppm.<i><sup><a href="/read/12781/chapter/4#chap2x-fnt1" id="chap2x-fn1">a</a></sup></i></p>
<p class="tx">Another, and perhaps more useful, way to view the problem is in terms of total cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (i.e., the sum of all emissions over time). How much greenhouse gas can be emitted and still keep the global temperature rise below 2°C? A rough estimate can be obtained using the near-linear relationship that exists between the cumulative carbon emissions from human activities since the Industrial Revolution and the long-term rise in the Earth’s average surface temperature.<i><sup><a href="#chap2x-fnt1" id="chap2x-fn2">b</a></sup></i> Based on this relationship, it is estimated that keeping global temperature rise within 2°C requires limiting cumulative emissions to approximately 4000 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. There is considerable uncertainty in this result however, with the cumulative emissions likely ranging from about 2900 to 5800 billion tons. Cumulative human-related emissions since the Industrial Revolution total about 1800 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. This leaves an “emissions headroom” (i.e., the remaining amount that can be emitted) of somewhere between 1,100 to 4,000 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, with a central estimated headroom of roughly 2,200 billion tons.</p>
<p class="tx">The world currently emits ~30 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year from fossil fuels, with one-fifth of this amount emitted by the United States. If global emissions continued at that rate, the central estimated headroom would be used up (as a rough approximation) somewhere in the range of 40 to 130 years, with a most probable value of roughly 70 years—after which point emissions would have to drop to zero. Thus the degree of headroom is uncertain—there could be very little left, or there could be a significant amount, depending mainly on uncertainties in the climate sensitivity.</p>
<p class="tx">These estimates are undoubtedly too optimistic however, because without policy intervention,</p>

<p class="h2"><b>CHAPTER CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p class="nonindent" id="p0040-03-2">Although the exact details cannot be predicted with certainty, there is a clear scientific understanding that climate change poses serious risks to human society and many of the physical and ecological systems upon which society depends—with the specific impacts of concern, and the relative likelihood of those impacts, varying significantly from place to place and over time. It is likewise clear that actions to reduce GHG emissions and to increase adaptive capacity will lower the likelihood and the consequences of these risks.</p>

<p class="ttx1">global emissions will not continue at current rates, but rather, will continue to rise. For instance, NRC, <i>Climate Stabilization Targets</i> projects that total global emissions between 2009 and 2050 will exceed 1,000 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub> under a scenario with no new policy interventions. If the headroom is at the lower end of the range listed above, it would all be used up by 2050 (and, of course, emissions are highly unlikely to drop to zero after that point). In addition, the available headroom shrinks if the goal for limiting global average temperature rise is more stringent than the 2°C target. These uncertainties illustrate how America’s climate choices fundamentally involve judgments and perceptions about acceptable risk.</p>
<p class="tx">Commitments to emissions in the form of the infrastructure investments will be key in determining how quickly we use up the emissions headroom. The world has already locked in a large amount of future emissions through both old and recent investments in capital stock (e.g., cars and trucks, home furnaces and boilers, building shells, chemical plants and factories, power plants) and fixed infrastructure investments. One study estimates that if the world were to build no further energy-using stock, while letting every existing fossil fuel-using device reach the end of its useful life without modification, somewhere in the range of 280-700 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub> would be emitted.<i><sup><a href="#chap2x-fnt3" id="chap2x-fn3">c</a></sup></i> How much is emitted above that amount depends critically upon the types of energy infrastructure the world invests in during the coming decades. If much of the new capital stock is powered by fossil fuels, then the emissions headroom will be rapidly depleted. If, on the other hand, concerns over climate change lead to concerted actions to slow the addition of new fossil-fuel-using capital stock, or if existing stock were retired early or retrofit (e.g., retrofits of coal plants to capture and store CO<sub>2</sub>), the headroom will last longer.</p>

</div>
<p class="nonindent" id="p0041-02-2">Waiting for unacceptable impacts to occur before taking action is imprudent because many of the impacts of GHGs emitted today will not fully manifest themselves for decades; and once they do appear, they can be with us for hundreds or even thousands of years. The amount of warming is expected to increase with the cumulative amount of GHGs emitted, and thus the chances of encountering dangerous climate impacts grows with every extra ton we emit. At the same time, national and world demand for energy is on the rise, and new investments in energy infrastructure are inevitable. If those investments are in CO<sub>2</sub>-emitting infrastructure, we will have committed ourselves to growing GHG emissions for decades to come.</p>

<div class="info-description">
<p>Climate change is occurring. It is very likely caused by the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities, and poses significant risks for a range of human and natural systems. And these emissions continue to increase, which will result in further change and greater risks.</p>
<p><em>America's Climate Choices</em> makes the case that the environmental, economic, and humanitarian risks posed by climate change indicate a pressing need for substantial action now to limit the magnitude of climate change and to prepare for adapting to its impacts. Although there is some uncertainty about future risk, acting now will reduce the risks posed by climate change and the pressure to make larger, more rapid, and potentially more expensive reductions later. Most actions taken to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts are common sense investments that will offer protection against natural climate variations and extreme events. In addition, crucial investment decisions made now about equipment and infrastructure can "lock in" commitments to greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. Finally, while it may be possible to scale back or reverse many responses to climate change, it is difficult or impossible to "undo" climate change, once manifested.</p>
<p>Current efforts of local, state, and private-sector actors are important, but not likely to yield progress comparable to what could be achieved with the addition of strong federal policies that establish coherent national goals and incentives, and that promote strong U.S. engagement in international-level response efforts. The inherent complexities and uncertainties of climate change are best met by applying an iterative risk management framework and making efforts to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions; prepare for adapting to impacts; invest in scientific research, technology development, and information systems; and facilitate engagement between scientific and technical experts and the many types of stakeholders making America's climate choices.</p>

It is very likely caused by the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities, and poses significant risks for a range of human and natural systems. And these emissions continue to increase, which will result in further change and greater risks.<\/p>\n<p><em>America's Climate Choices<\/em> makes the case that the environmental, economic, and humanitarian risks posed by climate change indicate a pressing need for substantial action now to limit the magnitude of climate change and to prepare for adapting to its impacts. Although there is some uncertainty about future risk, acting now will reduce the risks posed by climate change and the pressure to make larger, more rapid, and potentially more expensive reductions later. Most actions taken to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts are common sense investments that will offer protection against natural climate variations and extreme events. In addition, crucial investment decisions made now about equipment and infrastructure can \"lock in\" commitments to greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. Finally, while it may be possible to scale back or reverse many responses to climate change, it is difficult or impossible to \"undo\" climate change, once manifested.<\/p>\n<p>Current efforts of local, state, and private-sector actors are important, but not likely to yield progress comparable to what could be achieved with the addition of strong federal policies that establish coherent national goals and incentives, and that promote strong U.S. engagement in international-level response efforts. The inherent complexities and uncertainties of climate change are best met by applying an iterative risk management framework and making efforts to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions; prepare for adapting to impacts; invest in scientific research, technology development, and information systems; and facilitate engagement between scientific and technical experts and the many types of stakeholders making America's climate choices.<\/p>","bindings":{"print":{"P":{"isbn":{"0":"0-309-14585-6"},"isbn13":{"0":"978-0-309-14585-5"},"price":{"0":"29.95"},"binding":{"0":"P"},"for_sale":{"0":"on"},"free":{},"type":{"0":"print"},"word":{"0":"paperback"},"catalog_word":{"0":"PAPERBACK"},"bind_type":{"0":"print"}}},"pdf":{"pdf_book":{"isbn":{"0":"0-309-14586-4"},"isbn13":{"0":"978-0-309-14586-2"},"price":{"0":"23.00"},"binding":{"0":"pdfb"},"for_sale":{"0":"on"},"free":{"0":"on"},"type":{"0":"pdf_book"},"word":{"0":"PDF Full Book"},"catalog_word":{"0":"PDF BOOK"},"bind_type":{"0":"electronic"}},"globally_free":1,"pdf_chapter":{"isbn":{"0":"0-309-14587-2"},"isbn13":{"0":"978-0-309-14587-9"},"price":{"0":"2.90"},"binding":{"0":"pdfc"},"for_sale":{"0":"on"},"free":{"0":"on"},"type":{"0":"pdf_chapter"},"word":{"0":"PDF By Chapter"},"catalog_word":{"0":"PDF CHAPTERS"},"bind_type":{"0":"electronic"}}},"ebook":{"mobi":{"isbn":{"0":"0-309-30554-3"},"isbn13":{"0":"978-0-309-30554-9"},"price":{"0":"23.99"},"binding":{"0":"mobi"},"for_sale":{"0":"on"},"free":{"0":"off"},"type":{"0":"mobi"},"word":{"0":"Kindle\/MobiPocket"},"catalog_word":{"0":"MOBIPOCKET"},"bind_type":{"0":"electronic"}},"epub":{"isbn":{"0":"0-309-30553-5"},"isbn13":{"0":"978-0-309-30553-2"},"price":{"0":"23.99"},"binding":{"0":"epub"},"for_sale":{"0":"on"},"free":{"0":"off"},"type":{"0":"epub"},"word":{"0":"ePub"},"catalog_word":{"0":"EPUB"},"bind_type":{"0":"electronic"}},"formats":"Kindle\/MobiPocket,ePub"}},"product":{"isbn":{"0":"0-309-14585-6"},"isbn13":{"0":"978-0-309-14585-5"},"price":{"0":"29.95"},"binding":{"0":"P"},"for_sale":{"0":"on"},"free":{},"type":{"0":"print"},"word":{"0":"paperback"},"catalog_word":{"0":"PAPERBACK"},"bind_type":{"0":"print"},"webprice":26.955,"buy":"https:\/\/cart.nap.edu\/cart\/cart.php?list=fs&action=buy%20it&record_id=12781&isbn=0-309-14585-6"},"status":"final","authors":{"author":[{"sequence":"1","name":"Committee on America's Climate Choices","role":"Committee"},{"sequence":"2","name":"Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate","role":"Org","acronym":"BASC","url":"http:\/\/dels.nas.edu\/basc"},{"sequence":"3","name":"Division on Earth and Life Studies","role":"Division","acronym":"DELS","url":"http:\/\/dels.nas.edu"},{"sequence":"4","name":"National Research Council","role":"Academy"}]},"display_authors":"National Research Council; <a href=\"\/author\/DELS\">Division on Earth and Life Studies<\/a>; <a href=\"\/author\/BASC\">Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate<\/a>; <a href=\"\/initiative\/committee-on-americas-climate-choices\">Committee on America's Climate Choices<\/a>","report_type_description":"Consensus Study Reports published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine document the evidence-based consensus on the study\u2019s statement of task by an authoring committee of experts.

Analysts typically quantify risks along two dimensions&mdash;the probability that an event will occur, and the magnitude or consequence(s) of the event&mdash;and multiply the two to get a risk estimate (probability times consequence).<i><sup><a id=\"chap2x-kp1\" href=\"#chap2x-ss1\">a<\/a><\/sup><\/i> Consequences, however, have many dimensions. They vary in terms of which human values and concerns they affect (lives, livelihoods, community integrity, nonhuman species, etc.), where they are likely to occur, whom they may affect, and when they are likely to cause harm. Consequences also vary in terms of perception and significance to those who face the risks&mdash;for example, in the degree to which the consequence is understood or evokes dread (unknown risks can sometimes concern people more than other risks), and even in the trust in the organizations that manage such risks (mistrust in the managing organizations tends to increase perceived risk).<i><sup><a id=\"chap2x-kp2\" href=\"#chap2x-ss2\">b<\/a><\/sup><\/i><\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"p0032-P-2\">The risks posed by climate change are thus complex. As this chapter discusses, climate change drives a variety of biophysical processes, which leads to a variety of potential consequences for many things that people value. Risks will change over time, and consequences will be highly variable across different locations and population groups. Scientific analyses can improve understanding of the risks associated with climate change, including how different human reactions might change those risks and at what cost. One way this is done, for instance, is through scenario analyses that illustrate a range of possible future conditions and that can be used to test out the performance of different response strategies. But regardless of how much supporting scientific information is available, making choices about how to act in the face of uncertainty can prove contentious if people disagree about the nature of the risks they face or about which elements of these risks are most important.<\/p>\n\n    <p class=\"line\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n    <p class=\"fn\"><i><sup><a id=\"chap2x-ss1\" href=\"\/read\/12781\/chapter\/4#chap2x-kp1\">a<\/a><\/sup><\/i> C.

Future emissions (and future vulnerability to climate change) will be determined by a complex set of developments taking place around the world&mdash;related to population, economic growth, energy, land use, technology and innovation, and other factors. It is not possible to predict how all such factors will change in the coming decades, but scenarios allow us to explore the implications of different pathways.<\/p>\n\n  <p id=\"p0036-P-1\" class=\"nonindent\">The second source of uncertainty is the response of the climate system to the increased concentration of GHGs, or &ldquo;climate sensitivity.&rdquo; Even if future emissions were known exactly&mdash;that is, if a given emission scenario held true exactly&mdash;the magnitude of future climate change and the severity of its impacts cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, due to incomplete knowledge of how the climate system will respond.

This target is often stated to be equivalent to limiting global atmospheric CO<sub>2<\/sub> concentrations to no more than 450 ppm. Because of uncertainties in climate sensitivity, however, this is not a precise relationship. The best estimate from climate models is that there is a 50 percent probability of limiting global temperature increase to 2&deg;C or less if CO<sub>2<\/sub> concentrations are not allowed to rise above 450 ppm.<i><sup><a id=\"chap2x-fn1\" href=\"\/read\/12781\/chapter\/4#chap2x-fnt1\">a<\/a><\/sup><\/i><\/p>\n\n    <p class=\"tx\">Another, and perhaps more useful, way to view the problem is in terms of total cumulative CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions (i.e., the sum of all emissions over time). How much greenhouse gas can be emitted and still keep the global temperature rise below 2&deg;C? A rough estimate can be obtained using the near-linear relationship that exists between the cumulative carbon emissions from human activities since the Industrial Revolution and the long-term rise in the Earth&rsquo;s average surface temperature.<i><sup><a id=\"chap2x-fn2\" href=\"#chap2x-fnt1\">b<\/a><\/sup><\/i> Based on this relationship, it is estimated that keeping global temperature rise within 2&deg;C requires limiting cumulative emissions to approximately 4000 billion tons of CO<sub>2<\/sub>. There is considerable uncertainty in this result however, with the cumulative emissions likely ranging from about 2900 to 5800 billion tons. Cumulative human-related emissions since the Industrial Revolution total about 1800 billion tons of CO<sub>2<\/sub>. This leaves an &ldquo;emissions headroom&rdquo; (i.e., the remaining amount that can be emitted) of somewhere between 1,100 to 4,000 billion tons of CO<sub>2<\/sub>, with a central estimated headroom of roughly 2,200 billion tons.<\/p>\n\n    <p class=\"tx\">The world currently emits ~30 billion tons of CO<sub>2<\/sub> per year from fossil fuels, with one-fifth of this amount emitted by the United States. If global emissions continued at that rate, the central estimated headroom would be used up (as a rough approximation) somewhere in the range of 40 to 130 years, with a most probable value of roughly 70 years&mdash;after which point emissions would have to drop to zero. Thus the degree of headroom is uncertain&mdash;there could be very little left, or there could be a significant amount, depending mainly on uncertainties in the climate sensitivity.<\/p>\n\n    <p class=\"tx\">These estimates are undoubtedly too optimistic however, because without policy intervention,<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n  <p class=\"h2\"><b>CHAPTER CONCLUSION<\/b><\/p>\n\n  <p id=\"p0040-03-2\" class=\"nonindent\">Although the exact details cannot be predicted with certainty, there is a clear scientific understanding that climate change poses serious risks to human society and many of the physical and ecological systems upon which society depends&mdash;with the specific impacts of concern, and the relative likelihood of those impacts, varying significantly from place to place and over time. It is likewise clear that actions to reduce GHG emissions and to increase adaptive capacity will lower the likelihood and the consequences of these risks.<\/p>\n\n","25":"\n  <div class=\"box\">\n    <p class=\"ttx1\">global emissions will not continue at current rates, but rather, will continue to rise. For instance, NRC, <i>Climate Stabilization Targets<\/i> projects that total global emissions between 2009 and 2050 will exceed 1,000 billion tons of CO<sub>2<\/sub> under a scenario with no new policy interventions. If the headroom is at the lower end of the range listed above, it would all be used up by 2050 (and, of course, emissions are highly unlikely to drop to zero after that point). In addition, the available headroom shrinks if the goal for limiting global average temperature rise is more stringent than the 2&deg;C target. These uncertainties illustrate how America&rsquo;s climate choices fundamentally involve judgments and perceptions about acceptable risk.<\/p>\n\n    <p class=\"tx\">Commitments to emissions in the form of the infrastructure investments will be key in determining how quickly we use up the emissions headroom. The world has already locked in a large amount of future emissions through both old and recent investments in capital stock (e.g., cars and trucks, home furnaces and boilers, building shells, chemical plants and factories, power plants) and fixed infrastructure investments. One study estimates that if the world were to build no further energy-using stock, while letting every existing fossil fuel-using device reach the end of its useful life without modification, somewhere in the range of 280-700 billion tons of CO<sub>2<\/sub> would be emitted.<i><sup><a id=\"chap2x-fn3\" href=\"#chap2x-fnt3\">c<\/a><\/sup><\/i> How much is emitted above that amount depends critically upon the types of energy infrastructure the world invests in during the coming decades. If much of the new capital stock is powered by fossil fuels, then the emissions headroom will be rapidly depleted. If, on the other hand, concerns over climate change lead to concerted actions to slow the addition of new fossil-fuel-using capital stock, or if existing stock were retired early or retrofit (e.g., retrofits of coal plants to capture and store CO<sub>2<\/sub>), the headroom will last longer.<\/p>\n\n    <p class=\"ttx\">_________________<\/p>\n\n    <p class=\"fn\"><i><sup><a id=\"chap2x-fnt1\" href=\"\/read\/12781\/chapter\/4#chap2x-fn1\">a<\/a><\/sup><\/i> IPCC, <i>Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

The amount of warming is expected to increase with the cumulative amount of GHGs emitted, and thus the chances of encountering dangerous climate impacts grows with every extra ton we emit. At the same time, national and world demand for energy is on the rise, and new investments in energy infrastructure are inevitable. If those investments are in CO<sub>2<\/sub>-emitting infrastructure, we will have committed ourselves to growing GHG emissions for decades to come.<\/p>\n\n","26":"\n  <p class=\"ser\"><img src=\"\/openbook\/12781\/xhtml\/images\/26.jpg\" alt=\"img\" width=\"337\" height=\"724\"><\/p>\n\n  <p id=\"chap2x-fig2_5\" class=\"cap\"><b>FIGURE 2.5<\/b> The number of days per year in which temperatures are projected to exceed 100&deg;F by late this century compared to the 1960s and 1970s under two different scenarios of future GHG emissions (IPCC SRES scenarios B1 and AIF1, illustrated in <a href=\"\/read\/12781\/chapter\/4#chap2x-fig2_3\">Figure 2.3<\/a>).
